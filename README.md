The project is about creating an interactive self-help app called Ikigai, which is a Japanese concept of finding one's purpose in life. The app will have different agents that specialize in various aspects of one's life, such as physical and mental wellness, career and general purpose. The frontend will be built with Next.js and Tailwind, and the backend will use Python and Lanchain. The agents will also use Lanchain to communicate and coordinate.

To build the project, you can use any tools you like, but I have some suggestions that might be helpful. Some of them are AutoGPT, SuperAGI, MetaGPT, GPTEngineer, SmolDev, DevOps and Aider. These are some of the latest and most powerful tools for AGI development. I am also setting up a repository with e2b, which is a framework that simplifies the integration of different agents. I have also added an AI for reviewing pull requests and managing the project.

If you are interested in joining us, please let us know. I think this is a great opportunity to create something meaningful and innovative with AGI.


**Ikegai Achievement App with AI Assistant**

**Objective**: 
To develop an app that assists users in discovering and achieving their "Ikegai" (a Japanese concept that means "a reason for being"). The app will have an AI assistant that provides timely notifications and guidance to users on their journey.

**Components**:
1. **User Profile Module**: Collects user's interests, skills, passions, and values.
2. **Ikegai Discovery Module**: Helps users find the intersection of what they love, what they are good at, what the world needs, and what they can be paid for.
3. **Goal Setting Module**: Allows users to set short-term and long-term goals related to their Ikegai.
4. **AI Assistant Module**: Provides timely notifications, reminders, and guidance.
5. **Progress Tracking Module**: Tracks user's progress towards achieving their Ikegai.
6. **Community Module**: Connects users with a community of like-minded individuals.

**UML User Flow**:

1. **User Profile Module and Survey module**:
    - User signs up/logs in.
    - User completes a survey from where we get their interests, skills, passions, and values.

2. **Goal Setting Module**:
    - Agent sets short-term and long-term goals related to their Ikegai.
    - Agent brakes down goals into actionable tasks.

3. **AI Assistant Module**:
    - AI analyzes user's progress and behavior.
    - Sends timely notifications and reminders.
    - Provides guidance and resources based on user's needs.

4. **Progress Tracking Module**:
    - User updates their progress on tasks and goals.
    - Visual representation (e.g., graphs) of progress is shown.

5. **Chat Module**:
    - User talks with ai agent that acs as a guru/coach that helps him achieve it's ikegai.

**Agents' Responsibilities in the Backend of the Ikegai Achievement App**

1. **Time Agent**:
    - **Schedule Management**: Manage and organize the user's daily, weekly, and monthly schedules.
    - **Reminders**: Send timely reminders for tasks, goals, and other important dates related to the user's Ikegai journey.
    - **Time Analysis**: Analyze the user's time spent on various tasks and provide insights on time management.
    - **Time Blocking**: Allocate specific blocks of time for tasks to help users focus and achieve their goals.

2. **Survey Agent**:
    - **Feedback Collection**: Periodically collect feedback from users about the app's features, usability, and effectiveness.
    - **Ikegai Assessment**: Conduct surveys to help users refine and understand their Ikegai better.
    - **Goal Evaluation**: Periodically assess the user's progress towards their goals and their satisfaction level.
    - **Data Analysis**: Analyze survey results to gain insights and improve the app's features.

3. **Conversational Agent**:
    - **User Interaction**: Engage with users in natural language to assist, guide, and motivate them.
    - **FAQs Handling**: Answer frequently asked questions about Ikegai, the app's features, and user's progress.
    - **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze user's sentiments during conversations to provide tailored responses and support.
    - **Resource Suggestions**: Recommend articles, videos, and other resources based on user's queries and needs.

4. **Vector DB and DB Agent**:
    - **Data Storage**: Store user profiles, goals, progress, and other related data securely.
    - **Data Retrieval**: Fetch data efficiently when required by other modules or agents.
    - **Data Analysis**: Analyze data patterns to provide insights on user behavior, progress, and app usage.
    - **Backup & Recovery**: Regularly backup data and ensure a recovery mechanism is in place in case of data loss.

5. **Util Agent**:
    - **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor the app's performance and ensure all modules and agents are functioning optimally.
    - **Error Handling**: Detect errors or issues in real-time and initiate corrective actions.
    - **Updates & Maintenance**: Handle app updates, patches, and maintenance tasks.
    - **Integration Support**: Ensure seamless integration between different agents and modules in the backend.

By assigning specific responsibilities to each agent, the backend of the Ikegai Achievement App will function efficiently, providing users with a seamless and supportive experience on their journey.
