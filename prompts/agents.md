Here's the detailed technical specification for the Ikig-AI app, including the frontend, backend, AI agents, inter-agent workflow, file structure, dependencies, and integration with the Chroma database.

### Tech Stack Components:

#### Frontend:
- **Framework:** React
- **CSS Framework:** Tailwind CSS

#### Backend:
- **Language:** Python
- **Communication Layer:** Lanchain for decentralized communication

### AI Agents & Their Communication:

#### Communication Protocol:
- **Lanchain:** A decentralized communication layer for real-time, secure, and efficient inter-agent communication.

#### Time Agent:
- **Role:** Manages user schedules and sends reminders.
- **Integration:** Access user profiles and goals from the Chroma database. Sends real-time notifications using websockets.
- **Libraries:** `schedule`, `websocket`

#### Survey Agent:
- **Role:** Conducts user surveys and analyzes feedback.
- **Integration:** Fetches user data for tailored surveys. Stores feedback in the Chroma database.
- **Libraries:** `surveys`, `pandas`

#### Conversational Agent:
- **Role:** Engages users in meaningful dialogues.
- **Integration:** Uses NLP libraries for tailored interactions. Connects with the frontend using websockets.
- **Libraries:** `nltk`, `websocket`

#### Vector DB & DB Agent:
- **Role:** Manages data storage and retrieval.
- **Integration:** Interfaces with the Chroma database, ensuring optimal data management.
- **Libraries:** `sqlalchemy`

#### Util Agent:
- **Role:** Monitors app performance and handles errors.
- **Integration:** Utilizes monitoring tools like Prometheus.
- **Libraries:** `prometheus_client`

### Inter-Agent Workflow:

When a user sets a new goal:
1. **Time Agent** schedules tasks using the `schedule` library.
2. **Conversational Agent** engages the user using `nltk` for NLP.
3. **Survey Agent** periodically checks for feedback using tailored surveys.
4. **DB Agent** ensures cohesive user experience by managing data in the Chroma database.
